This repository is a collection of all files and scripts made or used in an attempt to create a list of homologous exons between humans, chimpanzees, and vervets 
and calculate the recombination rate and divergence value for each of the identified exons.

These files have been split into the separate folders on this repository based on what part of the pipeline they are a part of. All scripts have been added into 
a single folder called "scripts". Some files that are too large for GitHub are on the shared Google Drive "Primate_DFE_Project".

A file called FILE_DOCUMENTATION documents the folder location, purpose, and information contained within each of these files.

A file called PIPELINE gives a general summary of the various steps of the pipeline for this project.
